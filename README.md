# Data Processing and Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is designed to automate the collection, processing, and analysis of data from the Mastodon social media platform using Hadoop MapReduce, HBase, and Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts information from Mastodon, processes it with MapReduce, stores the results in HBase, and orchestrates the entire workflow with Apache Airflow.
